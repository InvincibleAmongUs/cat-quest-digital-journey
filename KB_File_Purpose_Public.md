# KB_File_Purpose_Public.md - Explanation of Public Directory Files

This file provides an explanation for files located in the `public/` directory. These files are typically served as-is by the web server.

### public/favicon.ico
*   **Purpose:** The default icon for the website, displayed in browser tabs, bookmarks, etc.
*   **Why it exists:** Standard practice for websites to have a favicon for branding and easy identification.
*   **Key Interactions:** Referenced automatically by browsers. Linked in `index.html`.

### public/manifest.json (To be generated by vite-plugin-pwa)
*   **Purpose:** A key file for Progressive Web App (PWA) functionality. It provides metadata about the application, such as its name, icons, start URL, display mode, and theme colors.
*   **Why it exists:** Enables PWA features like "Add to Home Screen" and defines how the app appears when launched as a PWA.
*   **Key Interactions:** Referenced in `index.html`. Used by browsers to understand PWA capabilities. Generated and managed by `vite-plugin-pwa`.

### public/placeholder.svg
*   **Purpose:** A generic SVG image used as a placeholder, likely for images that are yet to be loaded or are missing.
*   **Why it exists:** To provide a visual fallback and maintain layout integrity when actual images are not available.
*   **Key Interactions:** Referenced by components (e.g., `ImagePlaceholder.tsx` or `ImageBlock.tsx`) when an image source is unavailable or during loading.

### public/robots.txt
*   **Purpose:** A text file that provides instructions to web crawlers (like search engine bots) about which pages or sections of the site should not be crawled or indexed.
*   **Why it exists:** To manage how search engines interact with the site, preventing them from accessing private areas or overloading the server.
*   **Key Interactions:** Read by web crawlers. The current content (`User-agent: * Disallow:`) allows all crawlers to access all parts of the site.
